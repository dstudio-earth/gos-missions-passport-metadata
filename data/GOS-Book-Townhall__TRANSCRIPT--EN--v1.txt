Vanakkam ! 

You are coming along splendidly, and this is just the beginning of your journey!

In this game, it's humanity and the planet, versus the systems we've inherited.
The purpose of this game is to achieve global cooperation to regenerate our planet;
to create healthier local food systems, to distribute value more equitably, to give people more voice,
and to raise the collective quality of life; for not only humans, but all life on our planet.

We win when we create a society worthy of our grandchildrenâ€™s great-grandchildren.

To gain full access to the ecosystem and all the rewards within, you must advance through multiple levels by learning about and contributing to SEEDS, unlocking benefits as you go. 

Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is to book a town hall and connect with others in the community.

And in the meanwhile - I'll be helping to revive a river, in India.

Are you ready to play?
