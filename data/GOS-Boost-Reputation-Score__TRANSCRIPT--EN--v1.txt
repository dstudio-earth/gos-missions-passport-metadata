Good day! It's so refreshing to see you again.

Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is boosting your Reputation Score. Reputation Scores show how much trust the community has put in you, and vice versa. When you engage with the community through our platform, when you vote, you gain points. Similarly, if you do anything unfavourable, you lose points. The Reputation Score also counts towards Contribution Points. Having a higher score means you are a trusted member of the community. So, let's engage!

And in the meanwhile, I'll be at the Great Barrier Reef - helping document coral regeneration projects. Are you ready to play?
