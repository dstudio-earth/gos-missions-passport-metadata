Hola! 
Welcome to a new mission. You're making steady progress and it's beautiful to behold.

Our in-game Universe runs on the regenerative currency called Seeds. With Seeds, you can fund a whole new world of beautiful possibilities, co-created with other like-minded players. 
Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is to buy more Seeds. 
By doing this, you're supporting a regenerative renaissance and helping bring about a planet that runs on a conscious currency where you can make your dreams a reality. Buying more Seeds also means you can make zero-fee transactions as you lend your economic power to projects that are renewable, restorative and are good for the earth and all its inhabitants.

So go on, buy more seeds and make real change. 
While you're at it, I'll be learning how to build a yurt in Central Asia. 

Are you ready to play?
