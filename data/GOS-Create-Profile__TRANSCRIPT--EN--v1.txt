It's a breath of fresh air to see you again.

You've come a long way, and learned quite a lot about SEEDS in a short amount of time.
You've executed the missions, engaged with the community, and we acknowledge your commitment.
We are grateful you are here.

Now that you know SEEDS - we want to know more about you, and the many gifts you share with the world.
We want to learn about your passions.
To understand what you believe in.
To see what inspires you.
We want to know YOU.

Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is to complete your personal profile. 
All you have to do is show us your most authentic self.

While you're doing that, I'll be watching the cherry blossoms bloom. Each one is a gift, don't you agree?
