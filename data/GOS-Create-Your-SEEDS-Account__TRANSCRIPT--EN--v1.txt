Bienvenu! It's nice to see you again. Please make yourself comfortable.

For your next mission you need to create your SEEDS account, which will be permanently recorded on the blockchain where SEEDS lives. 
This is a very important step. You will be given 12 secret words (also called mnemonic), and a private key in the process. 
Make sure you save them somewhere safe when you are prompted to do so. 
This is vital to keeping your SEEDS account safe at all times. Otherwise, you may lock your Seeds in your account forever.

While you're creating your account, I'll be planting trees in the Carpathian mountains.

Are you ready to play?
