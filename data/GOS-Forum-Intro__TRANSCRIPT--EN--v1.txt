Hola. Welcome back to the Game of SEEDS. It's wonderful to see how you're advancing. The game is a community-based enterprise. And as part of the community, we want to know your hopes and dreams, your motivations and ambitions towards creating a new world. Now that we know a little bit from your profile, we'd love to hear more and be inspired. Our forum is called Engage. Head on over and pour your heart out to the community. You'll be making your first impression among the people you'll be co-creating this renaissance with. Let us know your purpose, and how together, we are going to turn your dreams into reality. Chances are, there are more likeminded people out there, just waiting to co-create your dreams with you. We're all waiting to hear from you.
And in the meanwhile, I'll be at an organic wine tasting party in the heart of a Spanish village, discussing how their organization is able to become more regenerative and revive their local economy.
Are you ready to play?
