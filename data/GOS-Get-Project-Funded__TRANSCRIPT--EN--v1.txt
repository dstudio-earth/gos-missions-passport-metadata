Hesi!
Welcome back-my friend. As always, seeing you is a sight for sore eyes. Your determination to change the world is invigorating.

Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is to propose a campaign. 

Campaigns are designed in a way to fund as many participants as possible. This is how we ensure Seeds spread to numerous new regenerators. Your campaign could take so many forms. It could be a beach cleanup that rewards participants in Seeds or sending out an email invite to get a network of new regenerators to sign up. Think up the possibilities and propose your idea in the Vote section. Residents and Citizens have the power to propose these campaigns so use this wisely. 

And while you are doing that, I'll be learning wood carving in Zimbabwe.

Are you ready to play?
