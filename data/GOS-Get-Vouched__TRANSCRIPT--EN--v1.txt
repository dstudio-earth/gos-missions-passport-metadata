Hello! It's so lovely to have you back on this journey.

Did you know, you need to get vouched for-by a community member in order to set up an account? A vouch is one way to gain reputation points and is how we build our "Web of trust".
If you received an Invitation to join SEEDS, you were automatically vouched for once. You can gain up to 3 vouches from the community. 
It's important to know that when being “vouched-for”, the reputation you gain is determined by the reputation and status of the account vouching for you. As such, when you vouch for someone, you are rewarded as they advance through the game. However, if the person you vouched for loses reputation points; that, will also impact your score. So please, choose your path wisely. 
Your next mission is to get Vouched.. Ask the community and you shall receive.

And while you're doing that, I'll be helping conserve dugongs alongside coastal communities in the Indian Ocean. 

Are you ready to play?
