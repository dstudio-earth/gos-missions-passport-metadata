Namaskar. It's an honour to welcome you back.

SEEDS, as a movement, works by inspiring people into action. Who are the people that support your cause? 
How can they benefit? Now is your chance to reward them. 

Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is to create a campaign proposal to invite your community. 
Then, reward participation, a regenerative act or even a simple act of kindness. We encourage everyone to think more 
deeply about solutions for the world we leave to our children and their children.

And while you're taking care of that - I'll be hanging out with a group of scientists, working on permaculture solutions 
in Tasmania!

Are you ready to play?
