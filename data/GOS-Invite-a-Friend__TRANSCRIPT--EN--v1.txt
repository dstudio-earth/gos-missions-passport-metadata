“Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant.” - Robert Louis Stevenson

Sowing seeds is one of the greatest principles in life. If we grow something in the right conditions; feed it, water it, and care for it; we can create something greater. We have the ability to build something that can multiply itself.

When you refer a friend or vouch for someone, you earn rewards each time they progress through the Game of SEEDS.
We encourage all members of the community to assist new members by sending invites and helping them understand the SEEDS Universe. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to invite one friend to SEEDS.

While you’re inviting your friends, I’ll be welcoming a pod of dolphins that I just met.

Are you ready to play?
