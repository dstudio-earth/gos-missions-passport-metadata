Ciao!  It's great to see you again.

Did you know there are several requirements to evolve to citizen status? One requirement is that you have made at least 5 transactions. Because you are a Resident, you can make fee-free transactions, payments, and fund transfers using Seeds. 
Another benefit to take into consideration is that your share of the Harvest is based on your Contribution Score, making it a win all around. Make more transactions, build the community, gain a bigger share of the Harvest, and become one step closer to your evolution to Citizen Status.

Your next mission is to complete 5 transactions.

While you’re doing that, I’m heading over to the marketplace to check out the new proposals from the community! 


Are you ready to play?
