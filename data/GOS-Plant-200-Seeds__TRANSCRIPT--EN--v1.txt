Hola!

You’re back so quickly. I love your enthusiasm.

Are you ready for your next mission? If you choose to accept it - plant 200 SEEDS. 

Think about planting seeds like putting SEEDS in a Savings account. When you plant SEEDS, you’re restricting your access to them in exchange for rewards, like increased “Planted SEEDS Points”; increasing the number of transactions you’re able to make. You can make an average of 1 transaction per week, per planted SEED; meeting one of the requirements to level-up to Citizen status.

While you're planting your Seeds, I'm going to help an urban permaculture co-op in Detroit. You see, we're all planting seeds today.
Are you ready to play?
