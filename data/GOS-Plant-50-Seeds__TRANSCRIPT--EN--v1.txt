Bem-vinda! You’re back so quickly. I quite enjoy your enthusiasm. Are you ready for your next mission? If you choose to accept it, plant 50 SEEDS in your account. Think about planting seeds like putting funds in a savings account. When you plant Seeds, you’re restricting your access to them in exchange for rewards like increased “Planted Seeds Points”; increasing the number of transactions you’re able to make, and meeting one of the requirements to level-up to Citizen status.
So while you're planting those SEEDS, I'll be on a trek in the Amazon, discovering traditional ways to regenerate forest ecosystems.
Are you ready to play?
