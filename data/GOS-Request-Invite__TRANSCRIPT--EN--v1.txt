Aloha!

Welcome to the first step of your journey, in The Game of SEEDS. 

The mission is to create your SEEDS account. But before you do-so, you first need to be invited. There are 2 ways to do this. One: You can ask a SEEDS member that you know to invite you. 
Two: You can request an invitation here, through the Passport; and a SEEDS Ambassador will then vouch for you, and let you in. 

In the meanwhile, I'll be practicing Mālama ʻĀina by volunteering with Volcanoes National Park in Hawaii.

Are you ready to play?
