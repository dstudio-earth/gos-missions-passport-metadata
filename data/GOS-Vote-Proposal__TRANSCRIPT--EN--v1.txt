Namaskar. It's so amazing to see you again. 

Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is to vote on a proposal. In the Game of SEEDS, citizens earn reputation when they vote on proposals. This shows they are participating in the governance of this new world. Every voting cycle, Citizens can choose to vote that they 'trust', 'distrust' or 'abstain' on new proposals. Every vote will mean you earn a little bit more reputation. 

Go on, share your voice. 

And while you're doing that, I'll be helping build a pre-school in Nepal.


Are you ready to vote?
