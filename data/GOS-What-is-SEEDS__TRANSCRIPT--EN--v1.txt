Jambo! It's a joy to see you again.. 

You are one step closer to leveling up to Resident status, and are now a co-creator in our new civilization. Because of your participation, you are helping SEEDS grow. The more SEEDS grows, the more valuable it becomes; and the better we can help drive the regeneration of our planet. 

Your next mission, if you choose to accept it, is to learn more about SEEDS, by watching the following video.

While you watch; I'll be learning from an elephant matriarch in the Serengeti.

Are you ready to play?
